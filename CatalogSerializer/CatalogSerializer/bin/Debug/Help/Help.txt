To serialize you'r catalog, you must use this pattern:
"Path to folder" FileName.customExpansion format
where:
1. Path to folder must be in double quotes and should not end with a symbol "\".
2. File name must not contain spaces.
3. File name can't contain expansion. Expansion can add automatically (depending on format), 
if you do not specify it.
!!! If the file already exists, it will be overwritten!!!
4. Available formats:
-bin - binary format;
-xml - xml format;
Example:
"D:" MyFile.exp -xml
