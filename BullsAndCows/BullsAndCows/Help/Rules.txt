To start game player must input count of digits in sequence.
The player make up a secret number (in which the number of 
digits must match the previously selected). 
Then the program try to guess player's number, who gives the number of matches. 
If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls",
if in different positions, they are "cows". Example: 
Secret number: 4271
Program's try: 1234
Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)
If the digit in the proposed sequence occurs more than in yours, then the number of "bulls"" 
and "cows" should correspond to the number of repeating digits in your sequence. Example :
Secret number: 1321
Program's try: 1113
Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "1" in first position, the cows is "1" and "3".
Other matches you must ignore)
When the sequence is guessed, you must enter a count of bulls that equal to sequence
size which you chose at the beginning.
